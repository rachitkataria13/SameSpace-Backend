## Concurrency Challenges

In a concurrent environment, multiple user applications may send requests to the database proxy API simultaneously. Some of the key challenges to address include:

1. **Data Integrity**: Concurrent writes to the database may result in data integrity issues, such as inconsistent or incorrect data.

2. **Resource Conflict**: Concurrent requests can lead to conflict for limited resources, such as database connections, leading to performance bottlenecks.


## Concurrency Solutions

To make the database proxy API suitable for concurrent environments, we can implement the following solutions:

### Caching / Memoizing

Introduce caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the database. Caching frequently accessed data can improve response times and reduce the number of database queries, minimizing conflict.

### Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests from each user or application. Rate limiting prevents one application from overwhelming the proxy API with requests, ensuring fair access for all users.

### Monitoring and Logging

Enhance monitoring and logging capabilities to gain insights into the application's performance and troubleshoot concurrency-related issues.
